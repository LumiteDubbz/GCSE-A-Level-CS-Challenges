# GCSE-A-Level-CS-Challenges
A repository for completed versions of common GCSE and A-Level Computer Science challenges.

# About
Lots of students partake in [these](https://www.ocr.org.uk/Images/260930-coding-challenges-booklet.pdf) GCSE and A-Level challenges and actually have to work to solve them. This repository aims to stop that. All code in this repository is licensed under the [MIT](https://github.com/LumiteDubbz/GCSE-A-Level-CS-Challenges/blob/master/LICENSE) license, meaning you have full control to use, modify and publish anything.

# GCSE versus A-Level
What's the difference?
- Programs in the GCSE folder are at GCSE qualifications.
- Programs in the A-Level folder are at A-Level qualifications.

As stated in the OCR page, the difference between the two is this:
```
For GCSE:
responses only need command line interfaces, and focus on using the programming techniques contained within the current specification.   

For A Level:
any solutions should have a graphical use interface created for it.  Use of OOP methodologies is to be encouraged, as many problems lend themselves to a class system.
```
